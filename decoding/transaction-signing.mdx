After creating her transaction, Alice has all the essential parts in place:

-   **Inputs** referencing her UTXOs.
-   **Outputs** specifying where the bitcoin should go.

However, the network will only accept her transaction if it’s **validly signed**. Let’s see how that works.

        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />

</div>

## 1. Why Sign the Transaction?

Signing a transaction proves to the Bitcoin network that **you own the private keys** for the UTXOs you’re spending.

Each input in a transaction references a specific previous output, which is “locked” to a Bitcoin script (Public-Key-Hash in this case).

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/signature2.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

By signing, Alice demonstrates ownership of the private key required to satisfy the conditions of that script.

## 2. The Signing Process

Let's look at a transaction with two inputs. Input 0 is locked to PKH1, and Input 1 is locked to PKH2.

Each input requires its own signature. For Input 0, Alice must use the private key that matches PKH1. For Input 1, she needs the private key that matches PKH2.

Before signing, the wallet creates a "cleaned" version of the transaction. This means all signature fields are temporarily empty.

Why use a cleaned version? Because:

-   Each signature needs to commit to the exact same transaction data
-   The order of signing doesn't matter
-   Verification becomes simpler and more reliable

The signing happens in steps:

1. The wallet takes the cleaned transaction
2. It hashes the entire transaction data
3. It signs this hash with the appropriate private key
4. It repeats for each input
