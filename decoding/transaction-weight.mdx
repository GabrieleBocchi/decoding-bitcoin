When sending Bitcoin transactions, we need to pay fees. But how does the network determine how much we should pay?

It all comes down to space - specifically, how much space our transaction takes up in a block.

## Transaction Size (Legacy)

Originally, measuring transaction size was straightforward:

<div className="text-center my-4 text-orange-500">
    $$\mathbf{Transaction\ Size = Bytes\ of\ serialized\ transaction}$$
</div>

This simple measurement worked because:
- Each transaction was just a series of bytes
- Fees were calculated based on these bytes



## Enter SegWit Transactions

The legacy system was simple, but it had a problem: transaction signatures.

Every Bitcoin transaction needs signatures to prove ownership, similar to signing a check. These signatures:
- Take up a lot of space (often 65% of the transaction)
- Were part of the main transaction data
- Could be slightly modified without invalidating them (transaction malleability)

This is where SegWit (Segregated Witness) comes in. "Segregated" means separated, and "Witness" refers to the signature.  

So SegWit simply means:
"Let's store the signatures separately from the main transaction data!"  



<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_5.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_5.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

SegWit splits each transaction into two parts:
- **Base data**: The essential information (addresses, amounts) - the "what"
- **Witness data**: The signatures - the "proof"


#### Transaction Weight

But splitting the data created a new challenge: how do we measure transaction size now? 
The solution was a new measurement called "transaction weight", calculated as:

<div className="text-center my-4 text-orange-500">
    $$\mathbf{Transaction\ Weight = (Base\ Size Ã— 4) + Witness\ Size}$$
</div>

For example, if you have a transaction with base data of 200 bytes and witness data of 100 bytes, the weight would be: (200 Ã— 4) + 100 = 900 weight units

This formula means:
- Base data counts heavily (4Ã— weight)
- Witness data counts lightly (1Ã— weight)

    ðŸ’¡ For legacy (non-SegWit) transactions, the entire transaction is considered base data, 
    so weight = size Ã— 4
