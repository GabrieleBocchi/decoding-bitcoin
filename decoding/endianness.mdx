Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored and read in a computer's memory.  

To understand it, imagine reading directions in different languages: while English Hex flows from left to right, Arabic Hex flows from right to left.

Similarly, computers have two ways to store data:
1. **Big-endian (BE):** Most significant byte first
2. **Little-endian (LE):** Least significant byte first

##  1- Big-Endian

Big-endian stores the **most significant byte** first. This is similar to how humans read numbers and Hex in most cases: starting with the most important information.

Suppose we want to store the number **12345678** (hexadecimal: `0x00BC614E`) in memory. In **big-endian**, the bytes are stored in this order:

<CodeSnippet
    language="Hex"
    code={`   00   BC   61   4E  `}
/>

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/technical-foundation/bigendian.jpg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/technical-foundation/bigendian.jpg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>


- **Most significant byte** (`00`) is stored at the lowest memory address (00).
- **Least significant byte** (`4E`) is stored at the highest address (03).

Big-endian is considered more "human-readable" because the data is stored in the order we naturally read it.

## 2. Little-Endian

Little-endian stores the **least significant byte** first. This might feel counterintuitive to humans but is more efficient for modern processors.

Using the same number **12345678** (`0x00BC614E`), hereâ€™s how it looks in **little-endian**:

<CodeSnippet
    language="Hex"
    code={`   4E   61   BC   00  `}
/>

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/technical-foundation/littleendian.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/transactions/technical-foundation/littleendian.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>


- **Least significant byte** (`4E`) is stored at the lowest memory address (00).
- **Most significant byte** (`00`) is stored at the highest address (03).

This "reversal" is common in Bitcoin's internal data representation.


## 3. Endianness in Bitcoin

In Bitcoin, **little-endian** is the standard for storing most data, like transaction IDs, block headers, and amounts. However, when this data is displayed to humans (e.g., in block explorers), it is often converted to **big-endian** for readability.

<TransactionCreation enabledFields={["version", "locktime", "amount", "sequence"]} />

## Bitcoin Transaction Example

Let's say a transaction output amount is **12345678 satoshis**. In Bitcoin:
- This value is stored as a **64-bit integer** (8 bytes) in **little-endian** format.
- To humans, the hexadecimal representation would look like this in **big-endian**:

<CodeSnippet
    language="Hex"
    code={`    00   00   00   00   00   BC   61   4E  `}
/>

- In **little-endian**, this is reversed:

<CodeSnippet
    language="Hex"
    code={`    4E   61   BC   00   00   00   00   00  `}
/>


If you were decoding raw Bitcoin transaction data, you'd need to reverse the byte order to understand the values correctly.

## Why Does Bitcoin Use Little-Endian?

Bitcoin uses **little-endian** because Satoshi developed it on a little-endian computer.  

Most modern CPUs are little-endian and the network protocols typically use big-endian, which can create a mismatch:
- **Big-endian** is used for network communication (called **network byte order**).
- **Little-endian** is used for internal storage in Bitcoin.

This duality requires developers to frequently convert between the two formats when working with Bitcoin data.
